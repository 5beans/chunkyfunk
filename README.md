Need a place to safeguard a few files I keep messing with. ~/ dotfiles, a few configs, other people's stuff hack'd in. Use 'em if you want.

I run Debian with a dedicated /home partition on a drive so I can maintain my config's throughout however many ridiculous installs I do. I haven't scripted anything, instead, borrowing from Leo 
https://github.com/leomarcov/debian-openbox/blob/master/README.md
to kick off some immediate install handiness following a Debian net-install, bare-bones. Then I login as root, install sudo, logout, log back in as me, and run a quick apt install to get my stuff back. I could probably make a live distro out of my system, or, any number of other ways to install my Debian system following a freesh net-install
